# Shopping-Customer-Segmentation-Clustering
This is a data analysis portfolio project that will allow you to perform customer segmentation on a specific group of mall customers. You will identify the best possible cluster using KMeans unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find the univariate, bivariate and multivariate clusters.  Once these clusters are identified, summary statistics can be performed on these to identify the best marketing group. The objective is to segment customers based on their behavior and characteristics, ultimately providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies and improving the overall shopping experience. 

The approach:

Data Collection and Exploration:
- Gather data on customer demographics, annual income and spending behavior.
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.

Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values and perform necessary data cleaning.
- Encode categorical variables and standardize numerical features.

Customer Segmentation (Clustering):
- Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means) to segment customers based on their shopping patterns.
- Experiment with different numbers of clusters and evaluate their interpretability using inertia scores.

Cluster Analysis:
- Analyze and interpret each customer segment.

Visualization:
- Visualize the customer segments using plots or charts.
- Use visualizations to effectively communicate the differences between segments.

Marketing Recommendations:
- Provide actionable marketing recommendations for each customer segment.
- Tailor promotional strategies, discounts, or events to suit the preferences of each group.
